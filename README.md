# Chirp! Water sensor

Chirp! water sensor is also known as plant watering alarm. This sensor helps to extend the life of plant by reminding person to water it.  This sensor is placed near a plant and it emits a tiny chirp when the soil is dry. It uses capacitive humidity sensing as opposed to resistive humidity sensing. This alarm sensor not only beeps at lower level but also sense light using light sensor present in it. The light sensor helps chirp to not let alarm to make much noise when it's dark. This sensor is not that difficult to work with if you know it's functionality properly and it's soul purpose is to remind person to water plant which helps in extending it's life.

# Component requirements

##### -> Raspberry pi3 B+
##### -> Chirp! Water Sensor
##### -> Male to female jumper wires and breadboard to test temporary circuit connections
##### -> PCB board with final circuit printed on it with correct address.
##### -> Socket header
##### -> Enclosure (case) to hold circuit together.


# Overall Budget

I was able to arrange soil from nursery and socket header from prototype lab. Their can be additional charges for that too if you want to buy that youself. Other than that overall budget will be same as shown in table.

# Time Commitment

This schedule is made before we started working on our project (to keep us on track).

The only thing you need to keep in mind is that you need to press restart button twice to bring sensor in active mode and to get readings.
