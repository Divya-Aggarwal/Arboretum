# Power-up (Week 11)

## Progress Report

In this week, I finish my readings retrival part and my sensor is working properly.

## Testing



# PCB Soldering (Week 10)

## Progress Report

I connect my PCB to raspberry Pi and finish all the connections. My connections are okay and my sesnor is working properly. Only problem I was facing with my connection part was I was not able to connect my sensor directly to PCB which I was able to sort further after consulting it with my teacher. 

I consult Kelly and Vlad and they told me to do connections with jumper wires as I have to dip almost half of my sensor in water (to do water level test) which is not possible to do if I connect my sensor directly to raspberry pi. If I do directly connect my sensor with raspberry pi, than while doing testing I have to make my raspberry pi wet and that is stupidity. So my sensor is connected to my PCB via jumper wires (male to female).

# Fritzing (Week 9)

## Progress Report

I am going well with my proposal and time schedule. I should have done my fritzing in this week and yeah i was able to cover up everything by this week. I was laking in sensor's reading part last week which I cover up in this week.

# Breadboarding (Week 8)

Resoultion: Kristian referred me to Vlad/Kelly for resolving the breadboarding problem.

## Initial Breadboarding:

After consulting kelly I get to know that 4.7 K Ohm resistors are required to connect in parallel to SCL and SDA clock wires.

## Final Breadboarding:
