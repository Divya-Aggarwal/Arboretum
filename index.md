# Power-up (Week 11 follow-up)(Nov 24)

## Progress Report

In this week, I finished my reading retrival part and my sensor is working properly.

## Testing

I have to press the button on my chirp water sensor to get it to stay connected. I just press the button and run my python code to keep it communicating in sensor mode.

### At first, I tested my sensor without putting any water in the soil and the values below are what I was getting:

### After getting normal readings I covered my LED with my hand to capture different brightness values as my sensor can measure light as well.

### At last, when I put some more water in the soil then the moisture level increased and thus my readings of moisture level also changed (increased).

# Power-up (Week 11)(Nov 13)


# PCB Soldering (Week 10)(Nov 6)

## Progress Report

I connect my PCB to raspberry Pi and finish all the connections. My connections are okay and my sesnor is working properly. Only problem I was facing with my connection part was I was not able to connect my sensor directly to PCB which I was able to sort further after consulting it with my teacher. 

I consult Kelly and Vlad and they told me to do connections with jumper wires as I have to dip almost half of my sensor in water (to do water level test) which is not possible to do if I connect my sensor directly to raspberry pi. If I do directly connect my sensor with raspberry pi, than while doing testing I have to make my raspberry pi wet and that is stupidity. So my sensor is connected to my PCB via jumper wires (male to female).

# Fritzing (Week 9)

## Progress Report

I am going well with my proposal and time schedule. I should have done my fritzing in this week and yeah i was able to cover up everything by this week. I was laking in sensor's reading part last week which I cover up in this week.

## Fritzing Breadboard

# Breadboarding (Week 8)

Resoultion: Kristian referred me to Vlad/Kelly for resolving the breadboarding problem.

## Initial Breadboarding:

After consulting kelly I get to know that 4.7 K Ohm resistors are required to connect in parallel to SCL and SDA clock wires.

## Final Breadboarding:
